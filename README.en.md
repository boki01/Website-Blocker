## About

Website Blocker is an application that allows you to block access to specific websites on your computer. It works by modifying the built-in 'hosts' file. The 'hosts' file is a system file that enables mapping of IP addresses to domains. Using this information, the application simply registers the unwanted website domain with the loopback address (127.0.0.1), which effectively blocks access to the website.
Website Blocker also uses the Windows default firewall to effectively block unwanted websites.

Application was developed in .NET framework, specifically using Windows Forms in C#, as a project for a networking class.
